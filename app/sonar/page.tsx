						Redesigning the <Span>Sensitive Data Monitoring</Span>
						dashboard to provide actionable insights{' '}
					</p>
					<Text title='Context'>
						In February, our design team migrated from an older
						design system to our new system and I was tasked to
						migrate our Data Security product flows. However, the
						Sensitive Data Monitoring {'(SDM)'} dashboard needed
						more than a migration to a new design system‚Äîit required
						a complete redesign to better address user needs and
						enhance its overall value.
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						<p>
							Taking note of past user complaints, I took the
							initiative to lead this redesign, collaborating with
							cross-functional teams to deliver a more actionable
							and insightful dashboard. I conducted user research,
							led the design iterations, and drove the
							implementation strategy for this project.
						</p>
					</Text>
					<Text title='What is Sensitive Data Monitoring?'>
						Sensitive Data Monitoring is a Rubrik application that
						helps companies manage confidential information in their
						data backups. For example, healthcare organizations have
						critical data about their patients and need to follow
						HIPAA regulations on how to handle that data. SDM
						assists in identifying who has access to the data, where
						the data lives, and how secure the data is.

					<Text title='Research'>
						To kick off the project, I collaborated closely with our
						UX Researcher to deeply understand our users&apos;
						mental models and pain points. Through extensive 60
						minute interviews, we gained insights into how users
						interacted with the SDM dashboard and their specific
						challenges in their roles. We then created a
						Jobs-to-be-Done framework to determine the ideal user
						flow. The key findings were clear:{' '}
						<span className='text-black dark:text-white'>
							users focused on managing sensitive data risks found
							the existing dashboard information irrelevant and
							non-actionable.

					<Text title='Design'>
						Our primary design goals centered on making the
						dashboard more actionable, insightful, and
						user-friendly. We chose to rebuild the dashboard from
						the ground up after discussing it with the design team.
						The previous dashboard was outdated by 2-3 years and no
						one could justify its rationale. This involved a
						complete overhaul of the layout, terminology,
						information hierarchy, and data visualizations to align
						with user needs and enhance the overall user experience.
