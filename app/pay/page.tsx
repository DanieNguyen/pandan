				</Title>
				<Text title='Context'>
					Within my first month at the Zebra, I identified the need
					for an redeign of the insurance checkout process. I
					initiated and led the redesign to create a more
					user-friendly and efficient checkout process. As the sole
					designer, I conducted a competitive analysis and UX audit to
					identify our weaknesses. I then led cross functional
					workshops, A/B testing with interactive prototypes, and
					iterative design efforts to successfully ship the redesign.

				<Text title='What is the Zebra?'>
					The Zebra is an online insurance comparison website, mainly
					known for their auto insurance. People are able to view
					multiple quotes from different carriers and compare
					coverages, benefits, and pricing. However, not many users
					know that they can purchase insurance directly on the Zebra.

					I developed multiple design iterations, including

					inspired by relevant product flows. I made sure to iterate

				<ImageWrap src={Layout} alt='Explorations'></ImageWrap>
				<Text title='Updated Flow'>
					I decided to move forward with the two column layout and
					information given feedback from stakeholders and its
					alignment with industry standards. With the new layout, I
					updated the payment section. I simplified the form and added
					a new review page. We then tested the existing designs vs
					the new flow.

					Diving right into the checkout redesign in my first 30 days
					was exciting. I learned a lot of things considering this was
