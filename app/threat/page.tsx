						Searching for <Span>cyber threats</Span> inside company
						backup data with ease
					</p>
					<Text title='Context'>
						I worked as the sole designer for Rubrik&apos;s new
						threat hunting feature. It was a project spanning 6
						months from conception to implementation. I conducted
						research, ideation, and designed the feature in 3
						months.
					</Text>
					<Text title='What is Threat Hunting?'>
						Recently companies are being targeted by ransomware
						attacks. With time, attacks are becoming more and more
						advanced. Ransomware can be dormant for months in a
						company&apos;s data - known as a payload. Threat Hunting
						helps discover payloads and any malicious actors in the
						data and can quarantine them.

					<Text title='Scope'>
						Given the constraints of the project, we were not able
						to conduct initial user research. But I worked with the
						PM to fully understand the scope of the project and the
						intended user flows for Threat Hunting. I summarized all
						the features we were going to implement and the user
						flow in Figjam.

					<Text title='Persona'>
						One thing we had to consider was how our typical Rubrik
						user would handle this new feature. Rubrik is primarily
						a backup tool and Threat Hunting is more a security
						tool. The backup admins will have to be introduced to
						the new feature properly.

						With the scope and goal in mind, I began to work on the

						I conducted and moderated 5 usability tests with a Figma
						prototype of the MVP designs. The feedback was mixed

						I adjusted the designs based on the feedback while

						<Span>
							updated the table columns to be simpler with
							additional filters.

					<Text title='Designing Complete Flow'>
						With the findings addressed, I worked on designing the

						This project was one of the most detailed projects I
