					<Text title='Context'>
						As a part of Applied 2020, I worked on a personal
						project mentored by senior designs from Facebook,
						Airbnb, Uber, and more. In 10 weeks I conducted
						research, ideation, and design for Spotify Podcasts. At
						the end of the program,{' '}

					<Text title='What is Spotify Podcasts?'>
						Spotify is the world&apos;s largest music streaming
						platform and is known for their great user experience.
						In recent years, they have focused on adding podcasts
						and audiobooks to become the source for all audio
						content.{' '}
						<Span>
							{' '}
							I was tasked to improve on Spotify Podcasts in any
							way I wanted as the challenge for Applied 2020.

					<Text title='Research'>
						To begin the project, I focused on discovering user pain

					<Text title='Discovering Podcasts is Hard'>
						The interviews showed that users really enjoyed

						listening experience. Their main pain point was
						discovering new podcasts.

					<h3 className='mt-8 text-black'>Key Findings</h3>
					<ul className='list-disc text-neutral-500 font-light leading-7 list-inside'>

					<Text title='Design'>
						After I determined the design goal for the project, I
						did additional research to help me ideate. I focused on
						the Spotify experience itself with a heuristic
						evaluation to identify the key issues users are having.
						Then I conducted a competitive analysis of all the top
						podcast apps to determine how they showcase podcast
						information and promote discovery.

						I then explored as many ideas as I could on how to
						explore podcasts. I categorized them by how much effort
						it would take to implement and the potential impact it
						would have on improving discovery. I narrowed the list
						to three main solutions but ultimately chose to try my
						idea of <Span>Featured Podcasts. </Span>

						The idea is that{' '}
						<Span>
							Spotify would show reviews and recommendations for
							podcasts curated similar to their music playlists.{' '}
						</Span>
						Since podcasts are more content heavy, the reviews could
						be articles similar to movie reviews with snippets of
						meaningful parts. This would be easy for Spotify to
						highlight new podcasts and help users discover new
						podcasts before listening to a full episode.

						I started to dive into the actual design of Featured
						Podcasts. The first step was to determine the
						information architecture of Featured Podcasts.
