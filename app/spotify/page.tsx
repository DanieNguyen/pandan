					Imagining a better way to{' '}
					<Span>discover Spotify Podcasts</Span>
				</Title>

				<Text title='Context'>
					As a part of Applied 2020, I worked on a personal project
					mentored by senior designs from Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, and
					more. In 10 weeks I conducted research, ideation, and design
					for Spotify Podcasts. At the end of the program,{' '}
					<Span>
						I received awards for Best UX, Best Presentation, and
						Best Visual Design.
					</Span>
				</Text>

				<Text title='What is Spotify Podcasts?'>
					Spotify is the world&apos;s largest music streaming platform
					and is known for their great user experience. In recent
					years, they have focused on adding podcasts and audiobooks
					to become the source for all audio content.{' '}
					<Span>
						I was tasked to improve on Spotify Podcasts in any way I
						wanted as the challenge for Applied 2020.
					</Span>
				</Text>

				</TwoImages>

				<Text title='Research'>
					To begin the project, I focused on discovering user pain
					points with Spotify Podcasts.{' '}
					<Span>I conducted 10 semi-structured interviews</Span> with
					podcast listeners to learn about their habits.
				</Text>

				<ImageWrap src={zoom} alt='zoom screenshot' />
				<ImageWrap src={flow} alt='user flow' />

				<Text title='Discovering Podcasts is Hard'>
					The interviews showed that users really enjoyed listening to
					their podcasts and had no issues with the listening
					experience. Their main pain point was discovering new
					podcasts.
				</Text>

				<div className='mx-auto md:w-2/5'>
					<h3 className='text-xl md:text-2xl mb-4 text-stone-900 dark:text-stone-50'>
						Key Findings
					</h3>
					<ul className='list-disc text-stone-600 dark:text-stone-400 font-light text-lg leading-7 list-outside'>
						<li>
							Users struggle to find podcasts on their own and
							rely on social recommendations
						</li>
						<li>
							Users have no way of judging the podcast besides
							listening to it
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<Goal title='Design Goal'>
					How can we help users discover podcasts easier?
				</Goal>

				<Text title='Design'>
					After I determined the design goal for the project, I did
					additional research to help me ideate. I focused on the
					Spotify experience itself with a heuristic evaluation to
					identify the key issues users are having. Then I conducted a
					competitive analysis of all the top podcast apps to
					determine how they showcase podcast information and promote
					discovery.
				</Text>

				<ImageWrap src={pain} alt='Spotify pain points' />
				<ImageWrap src={comp} alt='Competitive Analysis' />

				<Text>
					I then explored as many ideas as I could on how to explore
					podcasts. I categorized them by how much effort it would
					take to implement and the potential impact it would have on
					improving discovery. I narrowed the list to three main
					solutions but ultimately chose to try my idea of{' '}
					<Span>Featured Podcasts.</Span>
				</Text>

				<ImageWrap src={explo} alt='Explore Analysis' />
				<ImageWrap src={three} alt='Explore Analysis' />

				<Text title='Featured Podcasts'>
					The idea is that{' '}
					<Span>
						Spotify would show reviews and recommendations for
						podcasts curated similar to their music playlists.
					</Span>{' '}
					Since podcasts are more content heavy, the reviews could be
					articles similar to movie reviews with snippets of
					meaningful parts. This would be easy for Spotify to
					highlight new podcasts and help users discover new podcasts
					before listening to a full episode.
				</Text>

				<Text>
					I started to dive into the actual design of Featured
					Podcasts. The first step was to determine the information
					architecture of Featured Podcasts.
				</Text>

				<ImageWrap src={ia} alt='Information Architecture' />

				<Text>
					Then for the feature itself, I explored different homepage
					layouts for the Featured section and determined the
					information I wanted to show in each article.

				<ImageWrap src={ih} alt='Information Hierarchy' />

				<Text>
					With the foundation set, I began to put it together in high
					fidelity.{' '}
					<Span>
						I focused on maintaining consistency with the Spotify
						design language.
					</Span>
				</Text>

				<ImageWrap src={cards} alt='Cards' />

				<Text>
					With the high fidelity designs, I did some usability testing
					and users loved the feature. However, there was one problem
					with the component for the soundbite. It was too similar to
					the actual podcast episode component so I redesigned it.
				</Text>

				<ImageWrap src={sound} alt='Soundbite Exploration' />

				<div id='final'></div>
				<Text title='Final Designs'>
					After I addressed the final usability findings, I worked on
					finalizing the designs making sure it would be worthy of
					Spotify.{' '}
					<Span>
						Below are the final designs for featured podcasts.

				<Text title='Reflection'>
					During COVID with a tough job search, this project was a
					breath of fresh air for me. I loved working on this project
					and felt it really pushed me to become better. Some of my
					takeways:

				<ul className='mx-auto md:w-2/5 mt-8 list-disc text-stone-600 dark:text-stone-400 font-light text-lg leading-7 list-outside'>
					<li>
						Take time to focus on thinking of ideas instead of
						choosing your first solution. I felt that the early
						exploration really challenged my thinking and led to the
						right solution.
					</li>
					<li>
						Don&apos;t be afraid to change things even for a
						well-known company. All products will have pain points
						and can be made better.
